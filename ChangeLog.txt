3.7.2.5
	Changed module name of KopernicusSolarPanels to KopernicusSolarPanel,
	needed for latest version of Kopernicus.  Note:  For those few users using
	the older Sigma version of Kopernicus on 1.8.1, this will fail.  I've set
	the .version to make this 1.9.1 and later to avoid most of those issues
